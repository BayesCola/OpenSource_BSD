OpenSource_BSD Is Some Of My Part-time Projects Which Are Based On MS-VS2013. All Projects Follow BSD License.
## Introduction To The Repository:
###1. ctp_trade: 
The Project Intends To Became A Minimal Platform That Would Support Everyone Who Wants To Test Their Own Trade Strategies Temporarily And The First Version Was Released On April 8th. 2016. I Am Hardly Looking Forward Everybody, Who Plans To Devote To Quant Career But Now Has No Proper Opportunity To Make It Come True, To Join Me As Soon As Possible. I Awfully Believe That We Could Help All Guys To Achieve Their Dreams In The Future.
#####Relase Note:
1. Setting Up Redis3.0 Database Environment In MS-VS2013 And Connecting CTP-MD Interfaces To It Successfully. I Have To Say "Calling Redis Interfaces In Windows Platform, Especially In MS-VS2013, Is One Of The Most Trivial Jobs I've Done Before!". —— **April 8th. 2016.**
2. Complted 1 Minute K-Line Caculation, Which Is The Base Of Any Other K-Lines, Without Missing Market Data Consideration That Should Have Later, But In This Version I Commited, I Give Up Redis Cache Method Temporarily Because The Small Data Volume I Just Need To Forcus On.  —— **April 13th. 2016.**
3. The Next Step I Consider Is To Sieve Valid And Correct Sequential Market Data, And Caculate All Kinds Of Indicators Based On K-Lines Data. I Am Always Here And Waiting For Your Attention, Thank You.
