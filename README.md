## Introduction To The Repository:
###1. ctp_trade: 
The Project Intends To Became A Minimal Platform That Would Support Everyone Who Wants To Test Their Own Trade Strategies Temporarily And The First Version Was Released On April 8th. 2016. I Am Hardly Looking Forward Everybody, Who Plans To Devote To Quant Career But Now Has No Proper Opportunity To Make It Come True, To Join Me As Soon As Possible. I Awfully Believe That We Could Help All Guys To Achieve Their Dreams In The Future.
#####Relase Note:
1. Setting Up Redis Database Environment In MS-VS2013 And Connecting CTP-MD Interfaces To It Successfully. I Have To Say "Calling Redis Interfaces In Windows Platform, Especially In MS-VS2013, Is One Of The Most Trivial Jobs I've Done Before!". —— **April 8th. 2016.**
2. The Next Step I Consider Is To Sieve Valid And Correct Sequential Market Data, And Caculate 'Candlesick' Line According To Any Optional Demans.
